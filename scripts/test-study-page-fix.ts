âœ… Study Page Fix Applied!

The issue was:
1. The page was throwing a 404 error during SSR if exam data wasn't immediately available
2. This prevented the page from rendering at all

Fixed by:
1. Removed the immediate error throw
2. Added proper loading states
3. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

Now when you navigate to /study/[examId]:
1. You'll see "Loading exam details..." while data loads
2. If successful, you'll see the StudyModeConfig component
3. If error, you'll see an error message with a back button

To test:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/study/exm_1752676141404_bmxpdlbcn
2. You should now see either:
   - The study configuration form (if logged in)
   - A loading spinner briefly
   - An error message if something is wrong

The page should no longer be "stuck" or blank!
