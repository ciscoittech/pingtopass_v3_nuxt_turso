# ✅ Database Reseed Complete

## What Was Done

1. **Cleaned Database**
   - Deleted all questions, objectives, exams, vendors
   - Cleared session data and progress records
   - Used PRAGMA to disable foreign key checks during deletion

2. **Fixed ID Formats**
   - Vendors now use `vnd_` prefix
   - Exams now use `exm_` prefix (was `exam_`)
   - Questions now use `qst_` prefix
   - Objectives use `obj_` prefix

3. **Reseeded With Requested Exams Only**
   - CompTIA Network+ (N10-008)
   - CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)
   - CompTIA Linux+ (XK0-005)
   - Cisco CCNA (200-301)
   - AWS Solutions Architect (SAA-C03)

## Quick Start Buttons

The Quick Start buttons on /study and /test pages should now work correctly as they'll use the actual exam IDs from the database.

2. ✅ All relationships properly established
3. ✅ Questions linked directly to exams via exam_id
4. ✅ Objectives linked to exams
5. ✅ 130 total questions seeded across 5 exams
